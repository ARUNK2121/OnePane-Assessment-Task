# OnePane Assessment Task - Simple REST API

This repository contains a simple REST API developed as an assessment task for the company OnePane. The API fetches data from three URLs, stores the data, and provides output in a desired format. The primary focus of this project is on using standard library packages in Go, without relying on external dependencies. Instead of using databases, the project emphasizes the use of built-in data structures provided by the Go programming language.
